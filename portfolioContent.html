          <h1>Augmented Reality for<br />Interior Design</h1>
          <h2>An augmented reality mobile application for interior design</h2>
          <p>
            This project was developed as my final year project. The objective
            of the application is to help solve the challenges faced when
            purchasing furniture and designing a room/space. This application
            allows the user to select and place furniture and decoration in an
            environment through AR, there are also additional features such as
            changing the color of the wall and floor and also creating a
            collaborative session to design a room with multiple users.<br />

            <br />This project was fully developed in Unity with AR Foundation
            and ARKit.<br />
            â€‹
            <br />I'm really proud of this project as I was able to fully
            display my skills in Unity Development and UIUX design.
